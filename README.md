# Kayra Desktop Assistant

Kayra is a high-performance, intelligent desktop assistant designed to provide a robust, hands-free hardware and operating system control experience. Equipped with a hybrid **Centralized LLM Engine** and a continuous **Offline Speech Matrix** (Speech-to-Text & Kokoro TTS), Kayra translates your natural language spoken or typed queries into instant hardware actions, real-time web searches, or publication-grade deep research reports.

### ✨ New Features
- **Curated Orchestrator & Strict DMM Routing**: The Decision Making Model (DMM) has been mathematically mapped to 100% of the system's hardware automation functions, entirely eliminating LLM hallucinations or improper action execution.
- **Synchronized TTS Boot Sequence**: Kayra now features a highly advanced, line-by-line cinematic system boot sequence. Hardware interfaces and API states are analyzed and spoken aloud in real-time.
- **100% Offline Capability**: Automatically falls back to a locally hosted LLM Server if no internet connection or cloud API keys are detected, allowing complete offline hardware automation and chatting.

source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (automatically retrieves latest stable versions)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the root folder and update the API keys and configurations:

```ini
# Voice Configuration

## 📖 User Manual & Automation Commands

This manual outlines the exact natural language phrases, keywords, and text inputs to speak or type to trigger Kayra's automation protocols.

### 1. Web & Application Launching

Intelligently launches local apps or opens domains directly in the default browser.

- **How to say it:**
  - `"open notepad"` -> Launches the Notepad application.
  - `"open github.com"` -> Directly routes and opens GitHub in your browser.
  - `"open youtube.com, gmail.com, and linkedin.com"` -> Launches all three websites simultaneously in separate browser tabs.

### 2. Tab & Process Closer

Fuzzy-matches visible windows to close them. For browsers, it simulates target ALT-key bypasses to close specific active tabs without altering your windows.

- **How to say it:**
  - `"close notepad"` -> Instantly terminates Notepad.
  - `"close youtube"` -> Target and close active YouTube tabs in your browser.
  - `"close chrome"` -> Gracefully shuts down the entire Chrome browser.

### 3. System Hardware Operations

Directly communicates with system kernels and hardware controllers.

- **How to say it:**
  - `"mute sound"` / `"unmute"` -> Toggles global audio state.
  - `"volume up"` / `"volume down"` -> Increments/decrements volume by 10%.
  - `"increase volume by 25%"` / `"set volume to 80%"` -> Absolute volume calibration.
  - `"increase brightness to 75%"` / `"set brightness to 30%"` -> Changes monitor backlight.
  - `"lock the computer"` -> Locks your active Windows session.
  - `"shutdown the pc"` / `"restart system"` / `"sleep pc"` -> Power management.

### 4. Desktop & Window Management

Simulates clean structural layout changes to arrange your desktop.

- **How to say it:**
  - `"snap this window to the left"` / `"snap right"` -> Snaps the active window into a perfect split-screen.
  - `"maximize window"` / `"minimize window"` -> Adjusts active window state.
  - `"minimize all windows"` / `"show desktop"` -> Instantly clears the screen to reveal the desktop.
  - `"switch window"` / `"alt tab"` -> Cycles through active applications.
  - `"open task view"` -> Displays the Windows Task View board.
  - `"open action center"` -> Launches the Windows Notification panel.
  - `"open emoji picker"` -> Accesses the native Windows emoji keyboard.

### 5. Keyboard & Application Shortcuts

Quickly injects standard hardware shortcut combinations.

- **How to say it:**
  - `"undo that"` / `"redo that"` -> `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` triggers.
  - `"save the file"` -> Simulates `Ctrl+S`.
  - `"select all"` / `"find something"` -> `Ctrl+A` / `Ctrl+F` triggers.
  - `"open a new tab"` / `"close this tab"` -> Browser tab management triggers.
  - `"refresh this page"` / `"reload page"` -> Re-loads the active tab.
  - `"go fullscreen"` -> Toggles `F11`.
  - `"zoom in"` / `"zoom out"` / `"reset zoom"` -> Universal zoom levels adjustments.
  - `"open task manager"` -> Launches Windows Task Manager (`Ctrl+Shift+Esc`).
  - `"open run dialog"` -> Launches the Windows Run dialog (`Win+R`).

### 6. Media Playback Controls

Injects global OS-level multimedia keystrokes compatible with Spotify, YouTube, VLC, etc.

- **How to say it:**
  - `"pause the music"` / `"resume playback"` -> Toggles play/pause states.
  - `"skip song"` / `"next track"` -> Plays the next media file.
  - `"previous track"` / `"go back"` -> Plays the previous media file.
  - `"stop media"` -> Stops all background player actions.

### 7. Instant System Telemetry

Pulls real-time system diagnostics directly from PowerShell and WMI interfaces.

- **How to say it:**

  - `"system uptime"` -> Outputs how long your PC has been running since the last boot.
  - `"what is my ip address"` -> Retrieves local connection credentials.

### 8. Desktop Screenshots

The model builds a research plan (10 queries), scrapes index pools, deep-extracts full page contents (stripping boilerplate via BeautifulSoup), performs gap analysis, completes follow-up scrapes, and compiles a comprehensive, publication-grade markdown technical whitepaper saved in the `Reports/` directory.
